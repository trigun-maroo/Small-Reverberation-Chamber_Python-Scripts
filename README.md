# Small-Reverberation-Chamber_Python-Scripts

Creating this repository to make available Python scripts for a journal paper. 
The Python scripts are for the small reverberation chamber that I developed as a part of my doctoral work.

I may add other Python scripts if need be; however, for now, I am just adding the one which takes in several .mat files and yields their corresponding SPLs.
